The difference between npx and npm lies in their purpose and use cases within the Node.js ecosystem. Here's a breakdown:

{NPM will install the package & than execute it whereas NPX directiy execute the code directly and than uninstalls that package}

1. What is npm?
Stands for: Node Package Manager
Purpose:
Installs and manages packages (libraries or tools) for a Node.js project.
Provides scripts and commands defined in the package.json file (e.g., npm run build).
Use Case: You use npm to install packages globally or locally, manage dependencies, and execute predefined scripts.
Examples:

Install a package locally: npm install package-name
Install a package globally: npm install -g package-name
Run a script: npm run script-name
2. What is npx?
Stands for: Node Package Execute
Purpose:
Directly executes binaries from Node.js packages without requiring a global installation.
Used for one-off commands or running tools without cluttering your global or local environment.
Use Case: Use npx to run CLI tools directly without first installing them, which is especially useful for trying out tools or executing commands from dependencies not installed globally.
Examples:

Run a tool directly: npx create-react-app my-app
Execute a binary from node_modules: npx jest
Key Differences
Feature	npm	npx
Primary Function	Install and manage packages.	Execute binaries from packages.
Installation Needed	Requires installation first.	No installation required for direct execution.
Global Installation	Often used to install globally available tools.	Avoids global installation, runs locally or directly.
Use Case	Managing project dependencies.	Running commands or testing tools.
Example Scenario:
With npm:

Install a tool globally: npm install -g eslint
Run it: eslint file.js
With npx:

Directly run the tool: npx eslint file.js
(No need to install ESLint globally.)
